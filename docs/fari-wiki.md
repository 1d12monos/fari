# Introduction

<page-meta author="RenÃ©-Pier Deshaies-GÃ©linas" description="Everything you need to know to use Fari effectively."></page-meta>

Fari might seem like a simple application at first, but there a lot of more advanced features that you can leverage to boost your Fate online sessions to the next level.

This Wiki will go over the basic feature as well as the more advanced use cases step by step to give you the ability to use Fari at its full potential.

# Playing

When playing in real life, you go to you friend's house, sit at their table and just get started immediately.

Playing your favorite TTRPG with Fari isn't more complicated than that, though there are still a couple of things you should know before getting started.

## Online VS Offline

To start a new game session, Fari offers you the following two options:

- Playing Online
- Player Offline

### Online

When you play online, Fari will open a new connection with a server to authenticate you and then give you access to a unique link that you can send to your friends.

Sharing that link with people will give them access to your game

After they entered their name and joined a game, every modification that you do the game will be synced with all the players using something called `peer to peer communication` using the `WebRTC` protocol.

The data that is synced includes things like the index card, the drawing pad and even dice rolls.

### Offline

The Offline mode is useful if everyone are physically in the same room but the GM still wants to use Fari to manage their Scenes.

When playing in Offline mode, Fari won't connect to its server and won't generate the unique link cited above. It will instead just store everything locally temporarily.

This mode is also useful if for some reasons, some of your players can't connect to your Online game session. See more about that below.

## Player: Choose your Character

When a player joins an Online game session, they don't have a character linked to them yet.

Kind of like in real life, the player needs to pull their character sheet out of their bag and put it on the table.

To do that, a player simply has to click on the `Add a Character Sheet` link on the left of the screen.

![Add A Character Sheet](https://gyazo.com/5b88a09e2fe82674694b0366960b10dc.png)

You then have the ability to do three things:

- `Select` an existing character from the list.
- Create a `New` Character.
- `Import` a character based off a template your GM might have given you.

Once that is done, you are ready to play!

## GM: Managing Game Scenes

### New Scenes

When you start either an Online or Offline game, Fari creates a `New Empty Scene`.

From there, you can get started and start playing right away, but as you play, your players will move forward in the story and you will want to get a new scene going.

If so, you can create a `New Empty Scene` again by pressing the `New Scene` button.

### Saving

During a game session, there a very high probably that have to cancel the session early, but you probably don't want to loose your current scene and all the index cards you've added so far.

No worries, simply click the `Save Scene` button and Fari will save your scene so that you can load it in another game session.

### Loading Scenes

Wether you had to leave your last game session early or you've prepared scenes in advance for tonights game, Fari lets you load scenes on the fly during your session so that you are always on top of your game.

Use the `...` menu on the right and either click `Load Scene` or `Clone And Load Scene`

![Loading a Scene](https://gyazo.com/5f093ab4cdf5783d1f61818d1120251f.png)

> #### Load VS Clone and Load
>
> Everytime you create something in Fari, Fari creates a unique identifier and attach it to what you created.
>
> When you `Load a Scene`, you are truly loading _this_ scene. Which means that if you click `Save` during your game session, you will modify the scene you loaded.
>
> When you `Clone and Load` a scene, Fari will clone that scene and assign it a new unique identifier. So modifications done during the game session will be done on the copy of the scene and not the original.
>
> This can be useful if for example you want to have a "Scene Template" that you want to use or something along those lines.

# Tips and Tricks

## Use Images

Fari supports adding images to Character Sheet and Index Card fields very easily.

Simply go on the internet, copy an image in your clipboard and paste it in a field inside the character sheet or an index card.

## Index Card Roll Modifiers

Not every NPC needs to be a full-on character sheet, but the benefit of using character sheets in Fari is that you can easily click on a skill to roll 4dF + a skill modifier.

Well, Fari supports doing that for index cards as well!

By using the following syntax `[skill: modifier]` inside an Index Card description, Fari will automatically add a link at the bottom of the index card so that you can easily roll `4dF` a skill modifier.

# Internationalization and localization

Fari is available in multiple languages like English, Spanish and French but if you are interested in translating Fari in another language or update a bad translation, this document is the right place to start.

Fari's supported languages are split into multiple files where each file contains a list of keys used by the app and their translated values.

## Lokalise

Fari uses [Lokalise](https://lokalise.com/) to help with localization.

If you are interested in contributing to Fari's in a significant way, contact [RPDeshaies on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/vMAJFjUraA) to see about becoming an official Fari Translator.

Otherwise, take a look at the other options for translating Fari programmatically.

## Adding a new language to Fari

To add a new language to Fari, you can download the [english translation file](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/blob/master/locales/en.json) and update the values of each key.

Once the file is translated, [open a feature request](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/issues/new/choose) and upload the new file in the issue.

A developer will then integrate the file into the application.

## Updating a translation value

It's possible that something in the app was badly translated, in that case, you can find the proper [language file](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/tree/master/locales/en.json) and open an issue to say which key needs to be updated and what should be the new value.

Also, try to include the reason why the original value was not good.

## About Page

The About page is not translated using the translations keys like the rest of the pages, it instead uses one markdown file per language which is saved in [this folder](https://github.com/fariapp/fari/tree/master/lib/routes/About/page).

If you want to translate the app, you should also provide a translated version of the About page in markdown format.

To do so, you can [download the English About page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fariapp/fari/master/lib/routes/About/page/About.en.md) and translate its content in the language of your choice.

# Connection issues

It is possible that, depending on your internet service provider configuration, you might not be able to use Fari's online functionalities.

The reason for this is because Fari relies on something called peer-to-peer connections using WebRTC.

To be able to establish the connection between the GM and the players, Fari uses a server to get the IP addresses of the GM and the players and once it has them, establishes a peer to peer connection between them.

But, it might be impossible for Fari to get the IP address of certain users.

## Reason

Taken from the documentation of PeerJS, the peer-to-peer library Fari uses:

> A small percentage of users are behind symmetric NATs. When two symmetric NAT users try to connect to each other, NAT traversal is impossible and no connection can be made. A workaround is to proxy through the connection through a TURN server. - https://peerjs.com/docs.html

While PeerJS offers a free TURN server for the community, Fari cannot use it because it's linked to their free PeerJS Server which is often down because too many people use it and it reaches its concurrent user limit.

This is the reason why Fari uses it's own PeerJS Server.

## Solution

There are multiple solutions that Fari could use to fix this issue but they all come at a price, literally.

We could spin our own TURN server. Compared to the normal peer-to-peer scenario where users transfer their data between each other without any middleman, TURN servers are responsible for transferring all the data from one user to the other, which makes them very expensive to run. (min 400$ per year)

We could also use a real-time database like Google Firebase, but this could also end up being expensive (~1$ per GB transferred per month with a minimum of 10GB, so more than 100$ per year)

All of that said, we also need to consider the developer time / maintenance cost of maintaining those infrastructures.

## Other options

If someone in the community thinks there are other alternatives, I'm all ears.

For now, what I can say is that if you discover that yourself or friends can't connect to one another, you should look into using Fari's Offline Mode (for the GM) and share your screen with the rest of your friends.

## One last thing

It really saddens me to not be able to do more for this, but because Fari is free, and I'm mostly working alone on this, the money and the time investment required to be able to make Fari's online functionalities more reliable for everyone is too big.
