## Lullaby Bard

Bardship is a varied profession to say the least. A wide range of disciplines fall under this umbrella, each with their own diverse scope of ideologies and practices. One rare but memorable classification is the lullaby bard. These bards use their implement, typically a harp or other soft musical instrument, to calm and subdue those who allow themselves to become entranced in the beautiful tunes.

Lullaby bards have been hired for a variety of reasons, from helping insomniacs sleep, to tranquilizing escaped animals, to comforting grief-stricken or anger-filled individuals. On very rare occasions, a lullaby bard might be an adventurer looking to use sleep magic to their advantage while they journey.
